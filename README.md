# Arduino-AutoBot
  AutoBot is a project proposed to implement a new Bluetooth controlled design of a Arduino car.
  Here, we can control this car through our mobile. 
  Im using a famous Bluetooth module called HC-05 which is very familiar for the Arduino users. 
  Its a fully optimized car. we can control it like a real car. 
  Here, im using L298N motor driver module for two channels of motors. 
  The code will have several functions for better understanding and also for better execution.
  
  
# Parts used 
 * Arduino Uno
 * L298N motor driver module
 * HC-05 Bluetooth module
